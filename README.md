*Emoji Team Chaos Quiz!* is a "fun" web based VR game for 1 to 4 teams of 4+ people.

**Your team's goal is to look around and find the emoji that corresponds to the answer
to a question. It sounds easy but only 1 team member will be able to see the correct
answer.**

What makes *Emoji Team Chaos Quiz!* so great?

- It requires all team members to collaborate and take part.
- Lots of spinning around.
- Shouting.
- Emoji.

## Tech

*Emoji Team Chaos Quiz!* uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to render a 3D scene which you can look around
by moving ([orienting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/deviceorientation_event)) your phone.

It's all static HTML and JavaScript. There is no backend processing or database:
the game makes use of [cryptography](./js/util.js#L1) to provide pseudo-random
gameplay that's consistent across players.

> [!TIP]
> The code is a great resource for anyone who would like to practice refactoring.

### Limitations

> [!WARNING]  
> This was put together in an hour or 2 and, whilst it works, there's lots that could do with improvement.

- The player names are fixed. If you don't have at least 10 people then look at the
  [player listing](https://steady-toffee-d211b8.netlify.app/admin) and pick names based on team colours.
  You can modify [`js/participants.js`](./js/participants.js) and host the game yourself.
- The questions are fixed and there's only 20. Add your own in [`js/questions.js`](./js/questions.js).
